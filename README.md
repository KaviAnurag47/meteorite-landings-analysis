# Meteorite Landings Analysis

This project dives into NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset to explore meteorite fall events across the globe. Using Python and data visualization tools, it identifies patterns in mass, year of fall, locations, and meteorite types.

## 🌍 Objectives

- Understand the frequency and distribution of meteorite landings over time.
- Analyze meteorite masses and classifications.
- Explore geospatial patterns using coordinates and heatmaps.
- Visualize trends through charts and plots.
